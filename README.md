# Basic MDX Blog
This is a basic MDX blog without many bells and whistles. It was built using Gatsby, and by following Skillthrive's YouTube tutorial by Hunter.

Here is a link to the 26 part tutorial I followed: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW0RabRDhwwzVNhlOgQQgw6HJzXdM1MnT

I'll likely us this simple blog as a template towards improving my understanding of Gatsby and as a launchpad towards future projects.
